<h2 align=left>Introduction</h2>
<h4>Food insecurity in Singapore is a very complex challenge. Despite its prosperity, certain segments of the population face difficulties in accessing affordable, nutritious food due to various factors, including income inequality and rising living costs. The supply chain plays a crucial role in addressing these issues. Enhancing its resilience and efficiency could ensure a more equitable distribution of food resources, although the specific strategies to achieve this improvement are varied and require careful consideration.</h4>
<h2 align=left>Problem</h2>
<h4>Through our research, we realised that food wastage within food-aid organisations is the result of improper food-aid being donated being given directly to the recipient who may not be able to consume it. As such, we seek to simplify the supply-chain though information sharing between (food-aid-organisations/F&B companies with excess food) and the consumer to ensure that the recipient of food aid receives appropriate food that is nutritious and safe to consume with respect to their dietary requirements </h4>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<h4>We seek to target low-income families, old-folks homes(ageing population) and match them to food given that waste in Singapore is a very big problem.</h4>

<h3>Plan</h3>
<h4>We will execute our plan in 3 stages</h4>
<h4>Stage 1: Stage 1 will be a pilot phase. We will go and survey and find out which areas specifically have high food insecurity. We will use our food consumption index as a index that will help us in this along with other tools to help measure the food insecurity level in these areas. We then after identifying these areas, we will implement our program SourceFoods. We will also partner with NGO's who generate large amounts of foodwaste because of inappropriate food allocation within our program matching system. Within Stage 1, we will only partner with NGO's to optimise their existing food-aid programs. </h4>
<h4>Stage 2: We will depending on the take-up/participation rates will fine tune our approach. We will also expand our partnership to hawker centres, bakeries and supermarkets and integrate them within our platform. We will also use the data that we have collected from Stage 1 to modify our existing allocation algorithms. We will also do the relevant checks on the quality of the food they may provide before bringing them onboard our platorm. Within this phase, we plan to refine our Reinforcement Learning algorithm to better forecast demand and supply within the system.  </h4>
<h4>Stage 3: After receiving the results from Stage 2, we will launch Stage 3 throughout Singapore and make the platform accessable to all businesses who wish to contribute. We will also open our volunteering platform to the general public.  </h4>
<h3>How our Initial Data Collection works</h3>
<h4>1. Food Inventory Data
Types of Food: Information on the types of food available for donation
Quantity: The amount of each food type available for donation.
Expiration Dates: Tracking the perishability of food items to prioritize those that need to be distributed quickly.</h4>

<h4>2. Operational Data
Daily Production and Waste Reports: Data on the amount of food produced daily and the amount that goes unsold or wasted.
Peak Hours of Operation: Understanding when food surplus is likely to occur.</h4>

<h4>3. Beneficiary Profiles
Dietary Needs: Information on the dietary restrictions and preferences of beneficiaries.</h4>

<h3>How do we plan to solve food insecurity and food waste at the same time?</h3>
  
<h4>We seek to reduce food waste by collaborating with food-aid organisations, hawker centres, bakeries, restaurants and hotels to list their uneaten food which is still safe to consume on the website. We have also created a dashboard that can will help us better understand the demographics of those who have signed up on our platform. The item will then get listed on the website along with its to consume/expiration date along with other information on suitability which will help us create a more targetted and efficient way towards food allocation. 
We then will use the Oracle Autonomous Database which will will automatically run through each user profile and we will then use a algorithm to identify what is the most efficient allocation of food taking into consideration the different factors like distance, food type, caloric intake, age/medical suitability. As such this will ensure that those who need food will get food which is suitable, safe and nutritious. Within our algorithm that we will implement, we will do optimisation of location: needy within 1km of the hawker place will be notified about the item, and they will have to agree to get the item, and there is option to self pick-up or get it delivered (only for people with mobility issues). Those volunteers who have signed on our website will be notified of the “order” and tasked to deliver to the needy person (only for people with mobility issues). The needy will indicate that the item is collected on the platform, and then the database will be updated</h4>
