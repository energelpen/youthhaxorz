<h2 align=left>Introduction</h2>
<h4>Food insecurity in Singapore is a very complex challenge. Despite its prosperity, certain segments of the population face difficulties in accessing affordable, nutritious food due to various factors, including income inequality and rising living costs. The supply chain plays a crucial role in addressing these issues. Enhancing its resilience and efficiency could ensure a more equitable distribution of food resources, although the specific strategies to achieve this improvement are varied and require careful consideration.</h4>
<h2 align=left>Problem</h2>
<h4>Through our research, we realised that food wastage within food-aid organisations is the result of improper food-aid being donated being given directly to the recipient who may not be able to consume it. As such, we seek to simplify the supply-chain though information sharing between (food-aid-organisations/F&B companies with excess food) and the consumer to ensure that the recipient of food aid receives appropriate food that is nutritious and safe to consume with respect to their dietary requirements </h4>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<h4>We seek to target low-income families, old-folks homes(ageing population).</h4>
<h2 align=left>Solution</h2>
<h3>Initial Data Collection</h3>
<h4>1. Food Inventory Data
Types of Food: Information on the types of food available for donation
Quantity: The amount of each food type available for donation.
Expiration Dates: Tracking the perishability of food items to prioritize those that need to be distributed quickly.
  
2. Operational Data
Daily Production and Waste Reports: Data on the amount of food produced daily and the amount that goes unsold or wasted.
Peak Hours of Operation: Understanding when food surplus is likely to occur.

4. Beneficiary Profiles
Dietary Needs: Information on the dietary restrictions and preferences of beneficiaries.</h4>
